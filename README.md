# Unit-5-Code-Share

In total this code share is out of 100 points. Similar to previous assignments, there are three options. Unlike previous assignments, they are not designated as basic, intermediate, and advanced.

- Functionality (50 points)
  - Does your code work?
- Design (20 points)
  - Does your site look unique and pleasing to the eye?
- Code Organization (20 points)
  - Can I read your code and understand what it's supposed to do?- - Reflection (10 points)

The first option is to create a To-Do List. You should be able to add tasks to the end of the list, and get rid of tasks completed in any order. The list should be ordered in the correct numerical order, and should be updated after the insertion or deletion of any element.

Reflection:

this unit is similar to the previous unit, except that it adds tasks for loops and other functions to add  more functionality and possibilities. The unit is also adding arrays to the tool box, allowing the combination of multiple elements and store a lot of data in one place. This project is for me touched on the lesser know elements such as this.elements... as they are helpful in  implementing specific functions and are not useful in other applications. this unit is also a large project in terms of the amount of CSS needed to render, i learned a lot of CSS and JavaScript through this project and i found it to be the most useful and challenging project yet.
